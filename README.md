# Self Driving Car Projects

Part-1: Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion

Applied Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to autonomous driving problems. Train vehicle to detect lane lines, predict steering angle, etc., all based on just camera data. Followed by Sensor Fusion: to use an array of sensor data to perceive the environment around the vehicle.

#
- Project 1: Use Python and OpenCV to find lane lines in images and video stream
  - Github Project Repo: [https://github.com/madhavkarri/CarND-P1-LaneLines](https://github.com/madhavkarri/CarND-P1-LaneLines)

#
- Project 2: Write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video
  - Github Project Repo: [https://github.com/madhavkarri/CarND-P2-AdvancedLaneFinding](https://github.com/madhavkarri/CarND-P2-AdvancedLaneFinding)

#
- Project 3: Using Deep Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks classify traffic signs. Train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the German Traffic Sign Dataset
  - Github Project Repo: [https://github.com/madhavkarri/CarND-P3-TrafficSignClassifier](https://github.com/madhavkarri/CarND-P3-TrafficSignClassifier)

#
- Project 4: Using Deep Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks clone driving behavior. Train, validate, and test a model using Keras. Model outputs a steering angle to drive the car autonomously around the track
  - Github Project Repo: [https://github.com/madhavkarri/CarND-P4-BehavioralCloning](https://github.com/madhavkarri/CarND-P4-BehavioralCloning)

#
- Project 5: Implemented Extended Kalman Filter in C++. Used Kalman filter in conjunction with lidar and radar measurements to track bicycle's position and velocity
