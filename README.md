# Self Driving Car Projects

Part-1: Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion

Applied Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to autonomous driving problems. Train vehicle to detect lane lines, predict steering angle, etc., all based on just camera data. Followed by Sensor Fusion: to use an array of sensor data to perceive the environment around the vehicle.

- Project 1: Use Python and OpenCV to find lane lines in images and video stream
  - [Github Project Repo](https://github.com/madhavkarri/CarND-P1-LaneLines)

---
- Project 2: Write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video
  - [Github Project Repo](https://github.com/madhavkarri/CarND-P2-AdvancedLaneFinding)

#
- Project 3: Using Deep Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks classify traffic signs. Train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the German Traffic Sign Dataset
  - [Github Project Repo](https://github.com/madhavkarri/CarND-P3-TrafficSignClassifier)

#
- Project 4: Using Deep Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks clone driving behavior. Train, validate, and test a model using Keras. Model outputs a steering angle to drive the car autonomously around the track

Part-2: Localization, Path Planning, Control, and System Integration

Expand on sensor knowledge to localize and control the vehicle. Evaluate sensor data from camera, radar, lidar, and GPS, and use these in closed-loop controllers that actuate the vehicle. Followed by localization, path planning, control, and system integration

---
- Project 1: Kidnapped Vehicle (Sparse Localization): Localize relative to a sparse set of landmarks using particle filters. Implemented a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++
  - [Github Project Repo](https://github.com/madhavkarri/CarND-P6-KidnappedVehicle)

---
- Project 2: Highway Driving (Path Planning): Developed a path planner in c++ to safely navigate around a virtual 3 lane highway with other traffic that is driving at 50 MPH speed limit
  - [Github Project Repo](https://github.com/madhavkarri/CarND-P7-PathPlanning)

---
- Project 3: PID Controller: Implemented a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the car around a test track. The car and race track simulator provides cross-track-error and velocity to compute steering angle correction. Corrected steering angle maintains the car stay inside of the track lane
  - [Github Project Repo](https://github.com/madhavkarri/CarND-P8-PIDController)

---
- Project 4: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car: A system integration project to drive Carla, the Udacity self-driving car, around a test track. For this project, Robot Operating System (ROS) was utilized to implement core functionality of the autonomous vehicle system: traffic light detection, control, and waypoint following
