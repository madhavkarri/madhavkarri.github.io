# Self Driving Car Projects

Completed Part-1: Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion
Applied Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to autonomous driving problems. Train vehicle
to detect lane lines, predict steering angle, etc., all based on just camera data. Followed by Sensor Fusion:
to use an array of sensor data to perceive the environment around the vehicle.
